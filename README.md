MESSAGING SYSTEM

This application has the following features.

    1)Create an account(SignUp)
    2)SignIn
        i)Read Mail->[Reply]    
        ii)Write Mail
        iii)LogOut
    
Base file is MessagingSystem.java.

When we run base file,it will display a menu with following options;

    1)SignUp
    2)SignIn

First,we need to create 2 accounts to proceed with further transactions. When we create a new account a unique user name will be generated by the system which we will have to enter while logging in.

Once accounts are created we login by selecting SignIn option.Application will display the following menu;

    1)Read mail
    2)Write mail
    3)Logout

The functionality upon selectIng the above options is self explanatory.

Future scope of the project:
    This version of application can handle only the messages with single string without spaces,In future we may upgrade the software       to handle strings containing the Whitespaces.
